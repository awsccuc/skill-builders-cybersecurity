# Cybersecurity

## What is Security?

"IT security is a set of cybersecurity strategies that prevents unauthorized access to organizational assets such as computers, networks, and data. It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of sophisticated hackers." - [source](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/what-is-it-security.html)

## Why should you learn about Security as a student?

You have made an application for your college event registrations that handles fee collection. Since you will need to collect sensitive personal information such as credit card information, **encryption** must be used to protect this data. You need to have **access control** policies in place to limit data exposure and implement **multifactor authentication** for reliable authorized logins. To ensure that these security protocols are properly implemented you need to be well-versed in **Security**, **Privacy** and **Safety** protocols.
